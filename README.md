# PlayOnLinux-Scripts
This repository contains some scripts that I use in PlayOnLinux to various facilities.

The scripts are designed to be used only with versions of WINE-STAGING or specific versions. Both scripts were tested on Arch Linux.

If you use another distribution, edit the scripts as needed. Sites that need possibly be edited are commented in the scripts. Are simple modifications at most one or two.
